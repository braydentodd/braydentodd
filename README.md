### Hello world, I am Brayden Todd! ✌️ 

A little about me:
- 👨‍🎓 I am currently pursing my Master's in Computer Science at Colorado Tech!
- 💬 My happy place is working with Python, but I am comfortable with a number of other languages.
- 🏀 I am a HUGE basketball nerd, many of my side projects involve hoops analysis.
- 📊 I have experience in front end development, application development, database engineering, & project management.
- 📚 However, I am currently learning as much as I can on machine learning, computer vision, & AI.
- 🏗️ At the moment, my personal projects are dealing with big data, web scraping, machine learning, and computer vision. Hit me up to talk about it!

Thanks for dropping by, hope our paths cross! 🫡
